= What are the Purchase Request Samples =

The "Purchase Request" modules are a sample project that should demonstrate how to easily map a typical business procedure like the creation of a procurement approval (in a very simplified manner) to the Alfresco Repository and Alfresco Share.
The "Purchase Request" project maps the whole process
starting with data entry via a Share form, to the automated creation of an physcial order document and the approval of the purchase request through a simple review and approve workflow.

== Target audience and purpose ==

The whole project is considered to be a starting point to help new developers and integrators with different aspects of the Alfresco and Share customization and to demonstrate how to solve typical challenges that always come up during the learning phase like :
* How do I start a workflow from my java implementation code?
* How to I work with policies and behaviours?
* How do I dynamically create a content from a Share UI?
...

The whole project is and will be work in progress as I still has some rough edges but I will constantly add functionality and round down this edges. Feel free to make suggestions improvement and for new functionality.

= Project Structure =

The project of two artifacts a repository and a share artifacts that can be deployed as simple jar files. To ease the development and to have a clear seperation on development level, the whole sample application has been split into two seperate projects.

The Purchase Request repository module that contains:
* The content model defining a PurchaseRequest content type.
* Some behaviour for the custom content type. The behaviour triggers the creation of a request number, triggers the creation of the binary request form and starts the workflow if an assignee has been selected.  
* The approval workflow definition including a java code to start workflows from a behaviour.
* A simple webscript that creates a "Procurement" folder within the actual share site.

Purchase Request Share module contains:
* The custom content types form configuration (create and edit mode)
* A dashlet to trigger the content creation
